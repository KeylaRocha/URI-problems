# URI-problems
  Inside this repository you can find many solved URI problems that I've solved myself. Feel free to use then, but always try to solve them yourself before look for a solution. 
  All the files are in C++, maybe someday I'll make a Python version of all of them. Future plans.
  Some of the files are old, so they don't have any comments and aren't the best solutions, but they work...
  If someone doesn't know what URI is, here's the link: https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt.
  Have fun XD.
